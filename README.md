Project: FMCG Supply Chain Challenge by Codebasics



Objective:



Create a dashboard for the Supply Chain Management team of the

AtliQ Mart to understand why existing customers are not renewing their contracts and what business problems they are facing. To understand the problem we need to create a dashboard that provides insights of KPIs and helps the team to better understand the performance/Problems of the business.



 Knowledge gained from this project :



➽ I have used Power BI, MySQL, and MS Excel to perform the challenge.

➽ Also used DAX to measure the domain attributes that helps further to understand the issues.

➽ Gain business knowledge of the Supply Chain Domain.
